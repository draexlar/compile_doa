# Mungo to DOA and DOA to Mungo

**compile_f** contains the OCaml implementation for the *Compile* function, translating Mungo typestates into DOA

**compile_tests** contains examples used to test compile_f


**decompile_f** contains the OCaml implementation the *Decompile* function, translating DOA into Mungo typestates

### Known bugs
The implementation of *Decompile* currently defines the "end" state
